They feel that the board does meet their current needs. Within the last 1-2 months they have been discussing some emerging needs identified by the board to see if they can get people with certain expertise such as legal also fund raising and resource mobilization background

Sometimes used to direct actions and to set priorities","Yes, their mission and vision have just been reviewed. In 2018, there was an active strategic plan that was just about the expire, they were also just starting their journey as their PEPFAR prime IP. They were very focused on scaling up as a pepfar IP – given this, they decided to work under the expired plan while they scaled up – this has taken them a while, and have just now in 2024 finally completed their strategic plan (2024 – 2029) which has not yet been fully approved by board (in upcoming meeting).

They share it during staff meetings, and it is printed and available, but not all staff may be fully aware of it  or able to articulate it"
One,Organization Leadership,Q2. Strategic leadership,2,2,1,1_2_2,1,The board does not evaluate its performance on a regular basis.,"Not in a formal way yet; They have informally talked about, but still have some urgent priorities such as setting up other sub-committees as they only have one"
One,Organization Leadership,Q3. Performance evaluation and use of results,3,2,1,1_2_3,2,"The board rarely updates and adopt a set of policies to govern the organization in the areas of finance, human resources, fund development, and communications","The evaluation results are utilized more by the SMT – board does not really play a role in this. Some of the inputs do come from the board level, but the majority of it is coming from observations from the CMT
The board does have an opportunity to provide strengthening inputs thought it is not so formal – they bring their expertise and knowledge – they also provide direct inputs in the draft policies"
One,Organization Leadership,Q4. Board composition and qualification,4,2,1,1_2_4,4,The board has the right mix of skills and expertise to govern the organization and routinely consider diverse points of view from internal and external stakeholders and the composition of our board does reflect the community we serve.,"See above – have MOH and community representation, but not a diverse technical mix eg legal or other areas"

They have a set of policies and written SOPs for each policy that are reviewed and updated by the SMT and don’t necessarily go to the board. The board just looks at the policies. "
One,Organization Leadership,Q6. Strategic planning and capacity to organizational priorities,6,2,1,1_2_6,5,"The organization has set priorities, there is clarity on how to make decisions when priorities come into conflict with each other, the organization has a history of meeting key program or organizational goals and benchmarks and our capacity is sufficient to achieve all the goals.",The resource and advisory committee which has Lineo and 2 members of the SMT and 3 board members – they help make decisions; They do look at opportunities to look at alignment with their strategies – they have a decision making too that has scores that helps them make decisions. The new strategic plan tries to be more specific to help guide future decision making. 
One,Organization Leadership,"Q7. Engagement, feedback to management, Norms and values",7,2,1,1_2_7,5,"Our organization does provide regular opportunities for staff to express constructive feedback or concerns to leadership and Our organization invests some time or resources in reflection or learning, and Our organization does have a common set of basic beliefs and values that are written, shared broadly, and held by all or the majority of staff and Many staff members are culturally sensitive with respect to internal management or delivery of services.","They have regular staff meetings where staff can speak freely, have cost center levels, have department or project team meetings, so there are platforms where staff can provide updates and concerns. 

They have open door policy with supervisor and supervisee engagement. Also have staff appraisal processes. Have a whistle blower policy and a hotline and anonymous email address to write to with concerns

For major policy updates they present the proposed changes to a staff meeting and give people an opportunity to comment and provide feedback; There is also a formal grievance procedure."
One,Organization Leadership,Q8. Management and Operations Capacity,8,2,1,1_2_8,3,"Adequate capacities, to manage its finances; recruit, develop, and retain talent; and maintain critical infrastructure and systems","Overall yes, but the MOH funding is quite limited for the 6 centers they own. All their leadership team is covered by the MOH funding so it is not always adequate. Example: If they wanted to add another senior HR director, who has a large scope of also IT and transport – if they needed a new position, they are limited

They feel that they can get good quality staffing – they are moving towards integration so that they can leverage existing talent in the organization eg buying LOEs from the projects, cross project.

Their salary structure is NOT similar to the government structure – they are lower; Most people who leave Baylor will move to the government; Nurses leave for job security because of permanent
Salary scales are based on market research and they try to benchmark salaries with other NGOs and try to offer similar salaries. Major survey was done about 2 years ago.

Some of their cadres do not align with public service establishment especially at the community level; This includes
-	HTS counselors – these play a critical role for HTS
-	Professional counselors who also play a critical role in testing
-	Case managers
-	Specialized nurses such as cervical cancer nurses 
-	MOH structure has a nurse that has integrated services

In the sites where they work, they would be able to continue even if PEPFAR funding is taken away using their existing MOH Subvention staff that are currently there; The TA support is mostly given to the other 24 sites

How do they pare down their operational costs so that they are prepared for reduced funding? In the sustainability road map, government will transition highly skilled expertise to the government - they have tried to offer salaries that are not too far off from the government salaries

The only new area is them being a TA partner; So they are experienced as an implementer of services, but it’s a newer-ish area for them.

They have been getting TA - just need help continuing to keep updated with the latest HIV knowledge and expertise. They are a main clinical partner supporting the MOH and are well positioned to support local partners, but will still always need ongoing updating. 

Research portfolio could use strengthening. The local University mostly does social research – there is a research portfolio. It could be growth area to strengthen collaborations. LEBOHA – Lesotho Boston Health Alliance is also one that has a partnership funded by the MOH through a subvention. So they could also strengthen collaborations with subvention partnerships with others such as Lesotho red cross, etc.

Also knowledge management could do better - Its part of the strategic plan and mission"

Two,Program Planning,Q3. Annual work plans are collaboratively developed with inputs from key stakeholders and team members,3,1,2,2_1_3,5,Work plan developed with inputs from all relevant internal team members and all key stakeholder,"For MOH projects, they engage with heads of departments who engage with their respective teams, and the medical director consolidates the inputs from all the teams, then it goes up to the technical director who reviews and provides inputs to ensure strategic plans are integrated, and then final to Lineo

Heads of departments engage with the all their teams include service delivery teams such as nurses etc

Almost the same approach is used for PEPFAR projects, once they get the COP allocation and SOW, heads of departments speak with respective teams to get the inputs."

EGPAF covers 8 districts and Baylor 2, and sometimes EGHPAF is funded for certain things and Baylor is not, yet expectations are the same
Recognize the strain that local organizations face when given same expectations as INGOS, yet vastly less funding. They have been given platforms (through USAID the local partners meeting that was held in Joburg where they presented the journey from sub to prime. Also where USAID has invited partners to share feedback and inputs to local partners, even in panel discussions) to provide their concerns e.g. raising the challenge of proposal development and how expensive it is and they don’t have unrestricted funds to turn around a highly competitive proposal is a huge strain on the organization – they have seen a shift towards concept notes and co-creation from USAID which has really been helpful

Also should not have cost share requirements which they cannot meet but yet can meet the technical requirement

Two,Program Implementation,Q3. The organization ensures that there are adequate numbers of staff required to meet program management and delivery (staffing norms are aligned with scope),3,2,2,2_2_3,4,All required positions filled,Not currently but about 95% of the positions are filled – current open positions are due to turnover
